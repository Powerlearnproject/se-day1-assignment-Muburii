# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is a branch of computer science that Involves writing Instructions and build spftwares to solve problems in the real world.
Scalability - Able to handle large data  without affecting the efficienvy of the system
Efficient and reliable -  Maintain high qualty of the work being done

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Developing of Systems
Testing and Maintaning of the system
Deployment of the system to the people


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - This involves planning of the scope timeline and budget
Requirement Analysis -Functional and Non functional Analysis
Design -System architecture and User interface design
Implementation of the system - Coding of the system
Testing - Tested for bugs and security vulnerabilities
Deployment- Released to the users
Maintenance - Improve the system based on user feedback


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is Iterative and increamental while Waterfall is Linear and Sequential
In Agile it is able to adapt tho changes as compared to waterfall methodology which each phase is completted before moving to the next therefore low flexibility.
In waterfall testing is done at the end of development while  in agile testing is continous through the process.
In waterfall final product is delivered at the end of the project while in Agile there are increamantal releases through development of the system

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software development is responsible for developing the system which invovles coding and intergrating the system through frameworks databses and programming languages
A quality assuarance Enginner communicates with the stakeholders thus bridging the gap between the enginners and the stakeholders thets help in clarifying the requirements of the system
Project manager- leads the software development team in the development of the system.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The IDEs are softwares that provide a space for developing systems where The code is written, run and debugged while the VCS is used to update regular updates oof the system to the source code.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Change of the cutsomers requirements of the system.
Advancements of Technology e.g Programming languages,Frameworks 
Time Cinstraint thus they work under high pressure due to limited time given by the stakeholder.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance. 
Unit testing - Involve testing of individual units or functions of the system. Importance - ensuares each units works correctly.
System testing - Testing of the entire system once completed against the requirements. Importance -Ensures the system meets the business and technical requiremnts.
Acceptance Testing - Testing is done by the users of the system checking whether the system meets their needs. Importance - Confirms the system is ready for production
Intergration testing- Used to test whether differents components or functions are able to work together. Importance - Ensures different parts of the system work correctly.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. 
Prompt Enginnering is writing prompts and the  generative AI gives desired and accurate output
Impoved User experince where it is healpful to the user since it gives desired outputs
Improves Efficiency saves time for follow up


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- Tell me about the Importance to technology
Specific prompt - Explain the Importancee of Technology in the healthcare industry and the applications of Artificial Intelligence in Diagnosis
